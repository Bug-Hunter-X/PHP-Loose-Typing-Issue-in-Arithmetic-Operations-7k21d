# PHP Loose Typing Bug
This repository demonstrates a common issue in PHP related to its loose typing system.  The `bug.php` file contains a function that attempts to sum numbers; however, it unexpectedly produces incorrect results when the input array contains strings. The `bugSolution.php` file provides a solution to correct this behavior.
